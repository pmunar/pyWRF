==========================================

Installation guide for the pyWRF package.

This package is intended to be used with
the WRF analysis software and assumes that
there is a successfully compiled version
of this program installed in the system.

==========================================

Prior to the installation, be sure that the following Python packages
are installed in the system:

configparser
os
sys
datetime
contextlib
glob

If some of them are not installed, they can probably be installed via 
pip or conda repositories, depending on the system's Python installation.

In order to check if they are properly installed, one can try to import 
them from the Python prompt by doing:

	> import configparser
	> import os
	> import sys
	> import datetime
	> import contextlib
	> import glob

Once checked for the installation of these packages one can proceed with
the pyWRF installation.

In order to install the software, download the package from the GitHub 
repository:

	> git clone https://github.com/pmunar/pyWRF.git

Once downloaded, put the pyWRF folder in the directory where you want to 
install it (if you downloaded it elsewhere):

	> mv pyWRF /path/where/you/want/to/install/it

With the package in place, cd to the pyWRF directory:

	> cd pyWRF

and install it with the pip command:

	> pip install .

Note the "." at the end of the order. It is important!

Once installed (it takes a few seconds) it is almost ready to run.

Before running, the init-pywrf.sh script must be executed. It sets some
usefull and important environment variables. But before running this script
there are two changes that need to be done in it:

1- change the PYWRF_DIR value to the path where you installed pyWRF:

	> export PYWRF_DIR=/example/path/pyWRF

2- change the WRF_DIR value to the path where you installed and compiled
   the WRF software:

	> export export WRF_DIR=/example/path/WRF

Once it is done, the script can be executed:

	> ./init-pywrf.sh

This script must be executed every time that the pyWRF package wants to be
used. An easy solution is to make an alias and put it into the .bashrc file.
An example of the line that would go into the .bashrc file:

	alias init-pywrf=". /path/where/you/installed/it/pyWRF/init-pywrf.sh"

After that, before using the software, type:

	> init-pywrf

from wherever directory and the package will be ready.
