=================================

This is pyWRF, a Python package that will help you to run WRF analysis software in an easier way.

Up to now, this package woks only with the em_real analysis of input data with WRF. You can either perform a reanalysis of the input data or you can perform a forecast, depending on the end date that you specify in the configuration file.
